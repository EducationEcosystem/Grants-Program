This work will expose a huge number of developers to the Mintbase. Our 350k devs will get exposure to Mintbase and will build products on top of Mintbase to showcase its capabilities.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
We already have a community of 350,000 developers and we will use these 50 projects to train them on Mintbase.

We already have a competent team as well as we have our  website: https://educationecosystem.com/
