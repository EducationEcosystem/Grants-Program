If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.
In response to an RFP

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Our goal is to build real products associated with the Mintbase blockchain. These products will be created by experienced developers (average 5 yrs experience). Each project comes with complete recorded videos and source code. We have developers on our website and the proposal selected will suggest how many developers will get exposed to these projects thi will increase the community of Mintbase ecosystem. 

Projects related to:
Deploy custom marketplace 
Minbase templates, SDK 
Deploy e-commerce store and mint NFTs - Mintbase API
Decentralized platform that offers collateral-free NFT rentals 
Deploy Smart Contract with Mintbase JS

https://educationecosystem.com/elliottminns/lK6rL-how-to-build-advanced-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-in-nodejs

Goal is to teach the following traditional 350,000 developers how to use tech stack they command and use Mintbase to build their NFT products:


Web developers:
	Javascript developers
	Python developers
	Ruby developers
	PHP developers
	Java developers

Mobile App developers
	Android developers
	iOS developers
	HTML5 developers



### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
This work will bring a number of developers to Mintbase. Depending upon the selected proposal number of devs who will  get exposure to Mintbase will be decided and they will build products on top of Mintbase to showcase its capabilities.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
We already have a community of developers, depending on the type of proposal selected number of dev will get exposed to Minbase ecosystem.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
We already have a competent team as well as we have our  website: https://educationecosystem.com/
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
No, indirect competitors are udemy and coursera.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.
Depending on the size of the grant in 3-6 these 50 projects will be completed.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Will be produced once the type of proposal is selected.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 25,000 - 50,000 USD depending on the proposal

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Mintbase Modules

Will be provided once the type of proposal is selected.
